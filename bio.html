            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                Hej! My name is Paul Jackino. I'm passionate about living life fully, making meaningful connections, and becoming the best version of myself. 
                Life is about writing a compelling story—one filled with challenges, triumphs, adventures, and deep connections with others and the world around us.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thrive in international and diverse environments, embracing different cultures and perspectives. The Swedish concept of 'lagom'—finding balance and moderation—deeply resonates with me, shaping how I approach both work and life. My passion for problem-solving, creativity, and personal growth 
                drives me to seek out new opportunities and experiences that challenge and inspire me.

        <!-- My Journey Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>
                My path has been anything but ordinary. It began with a love for DJing and radio as a young boy, pretending to host radio shows in my bedroom. By age 13, I hosted a radio show 
                at my local college station, which sparked a lifelong passion for creative expression and communication.
            </p>
            <p>
                That passion grew into a career in radio, audio production, and eventually music composition. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Communication 
                from SUNY Fredonia, I pursued opportunities across the country, from Phoenix, Arizona, to my hometown in New York. Along the way, I explored diverse fields, including 
                organic farming, carpentry, manufacturing, and IT. Each experience shaped me, teaching me the value of perseverance, collaboration, and community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most notably, my entrepreneurial spirit led me to create <strong><a href="https://paulsrocketstoves.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul's Rocket Stoves</a></strong>, a venture dedicated to facilitating engagement with contained fire that inspires primal connection with nature and community. 
                This business embodies my mission to bring people closer to nature and each other.

        <section>
            <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
            <p>
                I believe in a future where technology enhances our human experiences rather than replaces them. I am driven by a deep desire to grow as a person, live with integrity, 
                and inspire others to connect meaningfully with the world around them. Whether through my work in IT, cybersecurity, creative projects, or community initiatives, 
                I always aim to bring energy, enthusiasm, and a solutions-focused mindset to everything I do.
            </p>
            <p>
                I take pride in adapting to new environments and working with people from diverse backgrounds. I bring passion, problem-solving, and a commitment to continuous learning 
                to every opportunity, always looking forward to the next great adventure.
            </p>

                When we get distracted, we need to bring ourselves back to love, which sounds trite, I know, but it's how things are. And there's a lot of irony here. We think that the more you give, the more you get, which is correct and proven. The irony is, it's not about getting more; it's about pursuing, doing, and exuding what we love.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bear with me here because I know that's trite and ambiguous, but over generations, we've veered away from this. Things like dating apps are really just about trying to get a partner; they're not based on love. What we should be doing instead is pursuing what we love—activities and endeavors—and through that, we would naturally meet others and synergize with those who are also doing what they love. We synergize with them, and this is how we should be reproducing—not the other way around.
            </p>

            <p>
                But alas, so many of us have come into this world surrounded by those who have been distracted and are just getting things because they see the paradigm of "you get what you give," so they are just trying to give to get—transactional. It's not based on love. And it's easier said than done, believe me. I have faltered time after time, but I keep coming back to this truth. Deep down, it's why I've rejected the easy way out of things like using dating apps. I struggle with things like web applications that service the pursuit of things we love—not just dating apps but also careers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yes, technology should be here to enrich our lives, to enhance it, but it shouldn't replace the act of living. If we're talking about dating, that means the act of exploring the world, enjoying this endeavor, discovering, and then synergizing with others who are on paths that collide with ours. This is a much more interesting story.

      This promotional video / mini documentary for the Fredonia Farmers' Market was a project I took on in 2021,
      entirely by choice — out of appreciation for the market and the people who make it possible.
      It has reached over 3,500 views and serves as an invitation to experience one of the
      greatest gathering places in our community.
    </p>

    <p>
      The video is a short introduction to the Fredonia Farmers' Market as a living, breathing
      community hub — a place where farmers, makers, neighbors, friends, and visitors cross paths.
      It highlights the energy of the market, the everyday magic of local food, and the spirit of
      the people who show up week after week.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal was to help promote some of the good things happening at the market:
      local agriculture, small businesses, artists and musicians, community connection, and a sense
      of shared place. I wanted the video to feel welcoming, honest, and grounded — something that
      both regulars and newcomers could recognize as “home.”

    <h3>Credits & Appreciation</h3>

    <p>
      While I wrote, directed, produced, and edited the piece, it was very much a collaborative
      effort. I’m grateful for the people who contributed time, talent, and gear to bring it to life:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chip Riewaldt</strong> – Equipment contributions, some camera work, and assistance with directing.</li>
      <li><strong>Jackson Hickey</strong> – Camera work.</li>
      <li><strong>Pat DePuy</strong> – Camera work.</li>
      <li><strong>Brandon Delcamp</strong> – Drone camera shots.</li>
      <li><strong>Fatima Tauqir</strong> – Coordinating the Goodbye-wave shot.</li>
      <li><strong>Market People</strong> – Being themselves and offering genuine testimonies.</li>
      <li><strong>Market Dogs</strong> – Adding joy, character, and a few tail wags to the atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This project reflects something I care about: using media, storytelling, and technical skills
      to lift up local communities and create something that feels meaningful and true.

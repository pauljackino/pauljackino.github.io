    <h4>Who</h4>
    <p>My name is <strong>Paul Jackino</strong>. Every song released under my name -- whether on Spotify, YouTube Music, or elsewhere -- is created by me, a real human being. I’m a songwriter, musician, and producer. No AI, no loops -- just raw skill and heart.</p>

    <h4>What</h4>
    <p>This is a <strong>split-screen music video</strong> of a song I wrote and performed -- one side showing me singing and playing acoustic guitar, the other showing me playing piano. The lyrics are overlaid on the bottom third of the screen. It's imperfect, honest, and fully human.</p>

    <h4>When</h4>
    <p>I recorded and assembled this video in early August 2025 -- right before moving out of my home in Fredonia, New York.</p>

    <h4>Where</h4>
    <p>Filmed and recorded in my house in <strong>Fredonia, NY</strong>, just before I moved out. I wanted to use that space one last time to capture something meaningful.</p>

    <h4>Why</h4>
    <p>I made this to showcase the <strong>authenticity behind my music</strong>. Yes, there’s a polished version of this song out there -- but this raw version shows the imperfections, the process, and the personal touch. It's not just a song -- it's a statement: I made this myself.</p>

    <h4>How</h4>
    <p>
      I used a click track at 80 BPM and recorded two sessions:
      <ul>
        <li>Guitar (my great friend Gary gave me in c2013) + vocals: played live while listening to a metronome in earbuds.</li>
        <li>Piano( my great friend Mike gave me in c2018): recorded separately while listening to the previous take.</li>
      </ul>
      I filmed both sessions with a <strong>Canon Rebel T5</strong> and captured audio using a basic microphone setup. Then I synced both recordings in post, added lyrics to the lower third, and spaced the two video channels side-by-side. This was all done simply, with care -- not for perfection, but for truth.
